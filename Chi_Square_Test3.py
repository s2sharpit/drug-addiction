#Performing the Chi-Square test to identify statistically significant features for the target variable. â€‹
#The most important features (highest Chi-Square scores) are:

#1.Physical_Mental_Health_Problems (0.957)
#2.Social_Isolation (0.831)
#3.Withdrawal_Symptoms (0.607)

#However, all p-values are greater than 0.05, indicating that none of these features have a statistically significant relationship with Addiction_Class.
