# corr_matrix["Addiction_Class"]- Pulls the correlation values of all features with Addiction_Class from the correlation matrix
# .drop("Addiction_Class") - Removes the targetâ€™s correlation with itself (which is always 1)
# .sort_values(ascending=False)- Sorts features by descending correlation with the target. So the most positively features come first.

#The highest positive correlation with Addiction_Class is Physical_Mental_Health_Problems (0.00798).
#The lowest correlation is Withdrawal_Symptoms (-0.00639).
#Overall, correlations are weak, indicating that individual features may not have strong predictive power alone.
